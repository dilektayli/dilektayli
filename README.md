# Hi 👋 I'm Dilek Taylı

Computer Engineer with a strong early-career profile, experienced in software development, 
AI-driven applications, and R&D-focused projects. I have worked on TÜBİTAK-supported research, 
web and mobile application development, and interdisciplinary projects combining data, 
machine learning, and real-world problem solving.

I enjoy building scalable software solutions, learning new technologies, and contributing 
to projects where engineering, research, and impact intersect.
